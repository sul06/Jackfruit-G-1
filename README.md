📘 Prescription Helper – Intelligent Symptom-Based Medicine & Dosage Assistant

This project is a Python-based clinical support tool that helps users identify suitable medicines based on symptom inputs while also generating dosage suggestions using BMI and severity analysis. The application uses a real Excel-based medicine database and matches symptoms through a tokenized text-processing algorithm. It includes essential safety features such as a child-protection lock (blocking prescriptions for patients under 15), warnings for dangerous symptoms, and prompts for doctor consultation during severe cases. The tool also offers a built-in diet planner module, lets users upload their own medicine databases, and allows saving prescriptions as text files. The entire system is built with Tkinter, providing an intuitive and responsive GUI for everyday use.

-----IMPORTANT-----  <br/>
To use the assistant an excel database with medicines and symptoms must exist, standard database is provided, simply run the program and click on "Browse Excel" and select the database file
